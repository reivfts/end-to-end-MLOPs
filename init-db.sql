-- SQLite initialization script
-- SQLite uses file-based databases, no CREATE DATABASE needed
-- Each service creates its own .db file automatically when initialized

-- This file exists for CI/CD compatibility but is not used by SQLite services
-- SQLite databases are created automatically:
-- - gateway/gateway.db
-- - user-management/users.db
-- - booking/bookings.db
-- - notification/notifications.db
